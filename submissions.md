**Overview**:

* Angel Lips is a record label dedicated to fine art; it could also be a museum, or a line of flight.

* We would like to digitally release your fine art (music/sound).

* These guidelines are subject to change at the discretion of Angel Lips at any time. It is our intention to keep this page updated as frequently as is humanly possible.

* If after reading, you think Angel Lips is a good fit for your art, please see here for more info: Distribution/Payment.

**Release Style**:

At the moment, all releases are digital only.

* We may reach out to you at some point to do a physical release on an unconventional format (i.e., not on cassette, vinyl, CD, MiniDisc)

* If you would like, you could give us eternal permission to do this on your behalf, if such a thing comes into existence.

**Cover Art**:

* We will provide cover art. We will not accept suggestions. This is to ensure aesthetic vision of the label; or rather, museum.

**Desired Genres**:

* While recognizing that new genres can/will emerge using fragments from the past, and that it is important to provide some guidance, here is a general outline:

      * Noise
      * Granular
      * Field Recording
      * Breakcore
      * Ambient
      * World
      * Alt-Idol
      * Dreampunk (read: Ghost Tech)
      * "Experimental"    

**I’m Still Reading; How Do I Submit?**

* You can simply DM us on Twitter: ![Link](https://twitter.com/AngelLipsSound)

* Use common sense with regard to copyright.

* Preferred formatting of submittal:

      * ALBUM NAME
      * ARTIST NAME
      * DESIRED PRICE FOR DIGITAL RELEASE (OR “ASSIGN”)
      * SOCIAL LINK(S) (IF DESIRED)
      * LINK TO PRIVATE SOUNDCLOUD SO THAT WE CAN LISTEN (please ensure downloads are enabled)

* If accepted, we will respond to your submission within two weeks. If you do not hear back from us in two weeks, it means we are not going to release your work; unfortunately we can not respond or provide feedback on all submissions.

* If accepted, we will send you a message via DM inquiring if you would still like to release with us; we will also inform you of the release date. Generally speaking, we will seek to avoid releasing on “Bandcamp Day”, as it is easy for releases on smaller labels to get lost in the frenzy.

**Concept 0 - Submissions: SLICEOFLIFE (2021(∞))**

**Purpose/Intent**:

    Documentations of the Other via immediate everydayness. A demonstration of new isolationism. Post-Art.

* Angel Lips has an ongoing series, which is called “SLICEOFLIFE”.

* For submissions, please hit the record button on your phone for 20 minutes, then send us the raw file.

* We will then make-up an Artist name, Album/Track title, and select cover art.

* Artist payment process functions the same as stated in the Distribution/Payment section.

**Concept 1 - Submissions: A Collection of Multiple Colors Interpreted by Various Artists for Indeterminate Periods of Time (2021(2))**

**Purpose/Intent**:

    Colors are often considered in an amalgamated manner, which all can understand: “green”, “red”, “blue”, “orange”, and so forth. However, despite our frequent desire to simplify, it is equally known that each color we encounter can be approached as a solitary microcosm; it is here we encounter such concepts as “neon pink”, “baby blue”, “canary yellow”, and an innumerable count of other variations. Therefore, rather than living a life which witnesses only an indistinct blur, we have instead chosen to take sight of each unique alteration that lights our existence.

**If interested, please make an auditory interpretation of a color within the samples (or assign a track to a color at random), and send us a DM with this info**:

    * Artist name.
    * Chosen color sample.
    * Track link via Soundcloud (private w/ download enabled).

* We will respond/listen to DMs erratically.

* Artist payment process functions the same as stated in the **Distribution/Payment** section.

**Why Angel Lips?**

* We are an experimental label dedicated to fine art.

## Angel Lips: Distribution and Payment
<br>
**Payment:**

* Artists receive 100% of digital sales.
  * Payment of digital sales will occur during/throughout the month of August, each year.
<br>
* Artists receive 80% of profits from any physical sales (per unit), should such physicals exist.
  * Payment of digital sales will occur during/throughout the month of August, each year.
  * Physical pricing will vary at the discretion of Angel Lips; if the consumer side price does not net profit for Angel Lips, the difference between that loss and the consumer side price, plus an additional 50%, will be paid to the Artist by Angel Lips.
<br>
* For example: presume the physical unit cost is $4, and Angel Lips sells it for $2 to the customer. You will receive $3. The higher the loss we sell for, the more money goes to the Artist.
  * The physical portion of our label is designed to be unprofitable for the label, and profitable for the Artist.
  * The variables in the above example will be communicated to you prior to release.
<br>
  * In the event that a “digital discography” is purchased by a consumer, the amount of the purchase, subtracted by the total amount of purchase price derived from albums created in-house (¥3,900 as of writing), will be divided amongst the Artists.
<br>
  * We have no discount on the “digital discography” price; in the event that we apply a discount, such a percent will not be equal to an amount higher than the in-house derivative value.
<br>
  * In simple terms, the ¥3,900 stated above will be the maximum discount on the “digital discography” price; the function of this is to rotate profits away from Angel Lips directly to the Artists.

**Digital Distribution (currently testing):**

* We encourage Artists to manage their own digital distribution; and, make whatever artistic changes they feel are appropriate in order to ensure distribution can occur.

* Digital distribution is, in our opinion, a faulty system as it currently stands, and we believe that the major services subject artists to unnecessary creative restrictions solely in order to increase their profits, as well as to cater towards unreasonable interpretations of copyright law (i.e., interpretations which heavily skew towards oppressing artistic expression).

* That said, we are currently testing digital distro services in an attempt to provide that to Artists. The Artist payment model for this has been devised in a two-pronged manner that would provide an initial recuperation of up-front costs by Angel Lips (on a per release basis), followed by a lessening of our percentage cut in order to maximize Artist payment while simultaneously providing some compensation for the labor cost of Angel Lips.

* If the aforementioned plan is still feasible after our internal testing period, the manner in which it functions will be presented in these public guidelines, and Artists will be reached out to individually to determine their interest. It is likely that digital distro with Angel Lips will always be an opt-in system. We can not guarantee that digital distribution will ever exist.
